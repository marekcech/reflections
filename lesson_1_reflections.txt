How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Quite greatly I am happy for that

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    You can make notes what you did in a specific version, you will never loose
    unnecessary hours and you can do fast redos when mistakes was done.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    When you do the commit manually you can create a notes there what you did, Google
    docs just save every letter type and it may be unecessary. Also you can choose the
    special amount which is logical for you to commit at specific time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    the files are connected an the change in one can effect the other, thats basic for 
    coding. Google docs are not cool for coding.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    Git log shows all commits with notes, git diff compares two commits and shows their difference

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    You will not be afraid to do those changes because you can return back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    PHP websites, anroid apps
